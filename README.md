# resolutionscience - proof of thinking concept concluded
> This a proof of concept Prototype to create a Peer Network Learning Experience
> The UI is written in Vue.js and safeFlow in JS and a test data REST api in node.js
>
> The last stable release was 0.5 https://github.com/healthscience/resolutionscience/releases/tag/0.5
>
 The peer network learning experience is now being evolved at https://github.com/healthscience/diyhstoolkit and runs on the SAFEnetwork https://safenetwork.org/
>
safeFlow prototype code explores bringing the ideas of an ECS (entity component system) together with modular Ledger called the Knowledge Bundle Ledger that facilitaties performing DML (Decentrlised Machine Learning).  https://github.com/healthscience/safeflow will be a rust implemenation.
> Demos and commentary at https://medium.com/@DIYHSLAB
> An electron-vue project forked as base for DIY HealthScience Toolkit


#### funcationality
> Setup public/private keys
> Observe data back from wearables to air quality data.
> Charts, tables and simulations visualisation
> Data from test datastore and SAFEnetwork (comming soon)
> Smart dashboards for N=1 experiments
